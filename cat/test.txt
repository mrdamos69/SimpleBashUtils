What is your attitude to the goto operator in C/C++ languages?
Most likely, when you learned to program,


You used it. Then you found out that it was bad,
and you forgot about it. Although sometimes with complex error handling...
no, no, there's try... throw... catch.
Or to exit nested loops ... no,
there are flags and a lot of difficulties.
Or when nested switch... no, no, no, there are the same flags.


And yet, sometimes in the silence of the night you allowed a sinful thought into your subconscious - "why not use goto here?
And the program seems to be slimmer, and it comes out optimally. Yes, it would be good. But no, you can't, you forgot!".
